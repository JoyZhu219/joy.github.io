          This passage is interesting because Vannevar Bush’s insights are surprising and informative when I found out that nowadays,there are still
          a lot of people seeking ideas on how to deal with overwhelming data around them. For a long time, scientific inventions help extend people’s
          physical powers. He focuses on the idea of extending abilities in the mind, including the human memory and the ability to record, store,
          and retrieve information. The ultimate machine, “memex”, and the camera-eye in the center of the man’s forehead reminds me of the Gopro camera
          with a head strap. Although the development of memex was not achieved in his lifetime, many of the ideas behind it have played a huge role in
          our technological advances.

          Long Live the Web
        </h3>

          The Web has only existed in this world for decades, but it is difficult to fully understand how important its role is in everyday life. Not
          only for generations growing up with the Web, but also for the older generations who later become accustomed to the widespread use of the Web,
          people have lived in a world where the Web is taken for granted. I totally agree with Tim Berners-Lee that we should protect and defend the
          right use of the Web. I think the lack of the basic knowledge about The Web and the Internet should account for universality of the Web being
          threatened by social-networking site like Facebook. A lot of uses do not know how social websites do with their data and information. When asking
          people about the meaning of HTML, HTTP or URI, the answer will probably be “I don’t know”. The Web is more like a tool rather than a place where
          all information can be shared. If Web users understand more about not only what the Web is, but also the essence of principle of universality, the
          objectives of changing the current situation and protecting principles can be easily carried out. As a result, the Web can finally connect the world
          with good use. “The goal of the Web is to serve humanity”. This is something we should not neglect.
