          I first got to know No Party For Cao Dong when I was in grade 8. <span class="titlestyle">Wayfarer</span> opens up with lush guitar melodies bouncing off of each other gliding seamlessly
          into a rhythm section that pushed the current of the song forward. The vocalist came in with a soft sung melody, I felt the sense of yearning and regret that was carried by his voice.
          The song builds up to a break in the instrumentation where the vocalist switches from a melancholic croon to an emotionally strained and raspy melody, as an explosion of instrumentation hits you in the chest.

          I was hopeless, stressed, and desperate as I tried to prove myself in a viciously intense educational system. These feelings came viscerally to life in melody and in rhythm -- the desperation and pain in <span class="titlestyle">Wayfarer</span>,
          a sense of playfulness in <span class="titlestyle">Grisly Me</span>, a passionate desire for communal hope in <span class="titlestyle">The Specter</span>. As people, we are not completely alone despite the senses of hopelessness and pain that we can experience individually.

          <span class="titlestyle">The Serville</span> for me, was a perfect companion at that time. When I hear the melodies, Iâ€™m going to be introspective as I think about my growth as an individual, with all of its emotional ebb and flow. As I listen to the vocal melodies move
          like an ocean current, from softly lapping to violently crashing, I will think of beautiful human beings with a lot of stress, pain, and lack of self-worth. But like the album itself, there is hope flowing underneath it all.
