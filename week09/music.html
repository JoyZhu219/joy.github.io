          This new album shows the band socially-aware and concerned about the current situation of young people not only in Taiwan.
          Its title, <span class="titlestyle">The Servile</span>, has many meanings. It could be literally translated as “Ugly Slaves Children”.
          It’s also a name of a method of writing poems. And it was a term used for women from lower castes in ancient China.

          However, lots of songs on the record focused on relationships and emotions in micro-scale. And of course love.
          As the band said, a lot of their music “might sound violent, but it’s actually about love, loving, and anti-violence”.

          “Wayfarer”, or "Shang hai" tells a dramatic yet at the same time poetic story about two lost soulmates.
          The lyrics are simple but also satirical. The quartet convey the pent-up resentment and pessimism.
